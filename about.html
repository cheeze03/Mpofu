            <h2>The Evolution of Sports Cars</h2>
            <p>
                From the early 20th century, sports cars have been synonymous with innovation and luxury. 
                Icons like the Ferrari 250 GTO and the Porsche 911 set benchmarks for design and performance. 
                Over the decades, advancements in aerodynamics, lightweight materials, and turbocharged engines 
                have taken these vehicles to new heights, making them faster, safer, and more efficient.

            <h2>The Future of Sports Cars</h2>
            <p>
                The sports car industry is evolving rapidly, embracing hybrid and electric technologies. 
                Manufacturers like Tesla, Rimac, and Lamborghini are pioneering vehicles that deliver 
                unparalleled performance while prioritizing sustainability. Imagine a car that combines 
                zero emissions with a 0-60 mph time of under 2 seconds — that’s the future we are heading towards.
